# Module 8 - Programming Assignment Problem 2

## Create a Simple Student Class

Develop a class named **Student** that holds the following data about a student in instance variables:

- name
- ID number
- major
- GPA

In comments, discuss which of these instance variables should be fixed - shouldn't be changed once object is created - and which can be updated. **Explain your reasoning.** Based on your decisions define the parameters in your constructor and appropriate setter functions. Make sure all instance variables are initialized.

Once you have written the class, write a test program, using conditional execution, that tests all of the class's methods. As a final test create a list of students with the information shown below and iterate over the list to generate the output shown below.

```text
Name            ID Number       Major           GPA
Joe Bella       9933            Web Development 3.8
Tucker Blank    3399            Nursing         3.0
Gayle Ujifusa   1011            Baking          2.8
Edna Anker      9875            Medical Office  3.0
```
