# Module 8 - Programming Assignment Problem 1

## Create a Car Class

Create a class named Car.

Insert class documentation that describes this class - see Canvas page: "Multiple Files and Module Documentation"

When the class is instantiated three instance variables are defined:

- _make
- _model
- _year

The constructor function should include the parameters make, model and year.

Six methods are to be created in the **Car** class:

- set_make(self,make)
- set_model(self,model)
- set_year(self,year)
- get_make(self)
- get_model(self)
- get_year(self)

Create a TestCar() function that

- creates a car
- prints the car's properties using the get methods
- updates the car's properties using the set methods and then prints them out to demonstrate that the set methods worked.
- Use conditional execution ("if \_\_name__ == "\_\_main__":) to call the TestCar function.
